A library (kind of) for implementing classical data structures in C.
By classical i mean the following:
- Linked list
- Double linked list
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary search tree
- Graphs (pending)

Every data structure has his own *_macros.h file to control the behavior when
doing some common operations like adding, removing, stacking, etc.
